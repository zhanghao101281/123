# PAI Reconstruction
Photoacoustic Imaging - Image Reconstruction

By using this software, we can recontruct the Photoacoustic Image. The input data extension is .dat. This software can be used to reconstruct the C-mode, B-mode (Maximum intensity projection) and B-mode for each slice. In this software, we implement the filtering non-local means denoising to remove the noise from the image. The Example of raw data is too big (50 mb), it is not possible to be uploaded here. But, if you need the sample data, please contact me at Kucing.kuantum@gmail.com.

The easiest way to install this software is using Anaconda Python.
